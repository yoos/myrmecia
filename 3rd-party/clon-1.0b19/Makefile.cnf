### Code:

# Installation prefix. This is used for installing Clon as follows:
# - $(PREFIX)/share/common-lisp/systems/ for the system file (ASDF 1)
# - $(PREFIX)/share/doc/clon/ for the PDF documentation
# - $(PREFIX)/share/info/ for the info documentation
# If any of these are unsatisfactory, you will need to edit the Makefiles, or
# do the installation by hand.
PREFIX := /usr/local

# C compiler configuration for sb-grovel and cffi-grovel:
CC := gcc

# Lisp implementation to use (for some installation processing steps only):
# Choices are SBCL, CMUCL, CCL, ECL, CLISP and ABCL.
LISP := SBCL

# Implementation paths:
SBCL_PATH  := CC=$(CC) sbcl
CMUCL_PATH := lisp
CCL_PATH   := ccl
ECL_PATH   := ecl
# -q is needed to remove 'bye' for version.cl to work properly.
CLISP_PATH := CC=$(CC) clisp -q

# For ABCL, we need something slightly different.
ABCL_JAR   := /usr/local/src/common-lisp/abcl/dist/abcl.jar
JAVA       := java
JAVAC      := javac
JAR        := jar
SED        := sed
ABCL_PATH  := abcl


# Programs for generating the documentation:
MAKEINFO = makeinfo
TEXI2DVI = texi2dvi
DVIPS    = dvips
CONVERT  = convert
