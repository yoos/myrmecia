TYPE can be one of :number, :short or :long.

A version number is computed as major*10000 + minor*100 + patchlevel, leaving
two digits for each level. Alpha, beta and rc status are ignored in version
numbers.

A short version is something like 1.3{a,b,rc}4, or 1.3.4 for patchlevel.
Alpha, beta or rc levels start at 1. Patchlevels start at 0 but are ignored
in the output, so that 1.3.0 appears as just 1.3.

A long version is something like
1.3 {alpha,beta,release candidate,patchlevel} 4 \"Michael Brecker\". As for
the short version, a patchlevel of 0 is ignored in the output."

  :description "The Command-Line Options Nuker."
  :long-description "Clon is a library for command-line option management.
It is intended to ease the creation of standalone Common Lisp applications by
providing a powerful and uniform command-line option interface.
The most important features of Clon are:
- [from the programmer's point of view] Centralized command-line options
  specification and management, including automatic generation of help
  strings, conversion from command-line / environment strings to
  application-level option values, global or on-demand option retrieval, and
  extensibility (the programmer can define his own option types).
- [from the end-user's point of view] Uniform command-line option syntax
  across Clonified applications, including customization of the help strings
  layout (with optional ISO6429 coloring on terminals that support it),
  possibly abbreviated option calls and short/long syntax."
